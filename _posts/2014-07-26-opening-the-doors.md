I am proud to say that Corqboard is officially 'live' as of today!
------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting today Corqboard is opening it's doors exclusively to Stanford students.

The last few months have been a long, hard road of bringing Corqboard to life and building it into a production-class app that can handle traffic from millions of students. That also means this blog has been sitting idley on the backburner until now. 


Rather than talk about the next steps or dive into the technical challenges building Corqboard, I will keep it simple and say that I am so excited to see how you will use it - to hear about your stories finding the things you need, making extra cash, meeting your future roommates/spouses(!), and just simply interacting with and helping the people around you every day. Corqboard is the ship and YOU are at the helm.

Remember to:

- Create fun, useful pins that people need (with good pictures)
- Fill out your profile and add a photo to get more views, and so other members can see who they're dealing with
- Add payment methods so other members can easily buy your stuff (you only need to enter them once)

Corqboard is built entirely on trust and transparency, and by filling out your profile and creating awesome pins that people need, you will help shape the community as it grows, and you will help people like yourself along the way.

I can't wait to start this voyage with you--

-Dustin C.
