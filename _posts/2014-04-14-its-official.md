After a few hours of hacking around with Jekyll, I've created the first strokes of what is the official corqbord blog. I want to thank Tom Preston-Warner and Zac Holman of Github fame for the inspiration using Jekyll and the new Github Pages technology where this blog is 'hosted'. 

What you will find here
-----------------------

You will find the important news, updates and feature releases, but you will also find the trials, triumphs, failures, and philisophical musings of a start-up as it grows. And, with a little luck, hopefully I will be able to convey what it's like being on the ground-floor.

You'll find this blog to be a bit more personal than most and that's for two reasons: 

1. Being personal is one of the great benefits of a small company. 
2. I wanted to create a blog that reflects the corqboard community.

I wanted to avoid being like the blogs that are used only like a microphone - 'Hey! Check out this new feature we built!' 


I want to hear from each one of you.
